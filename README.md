# QA Sample Work â€“ Marcin Trusiewicz

This repository presents a small sample of my work as a QA engineer, including:

- Sample manual test cases
- API tests created in Postman

All examples are simplified versions of real-world scenarios Iâ€™ve worked on or recreated during training. Iâ€™m open to feedback and discussions.
